During my last Summer vacation, I had the chance of participating of the Hackatruck, which is a IBM project in partnership with the Eldorado Institute, Apple and Epson. For three weeks, we had a truck full of technologies parked at the PUC-Rio campus and, inside it(!), we had classes about Swift Programming and Entrepreneurship. Also, everyday after the classes, we had talks about some IBM technologies like Bluemix and Watson.

The students were divided in groups and each group had to develop a prototype of an app. The theme of my group was education, so we created an app to help people on finding tutors. Our intructors helped us a lot, not only with programming but also with developing our idea for the app.

The three weeks passed so fast we didn't feel it! The classes were super engaging and full of challenges. Besides our final project, we also created some mini apps for practice and learned a bit of every aspect of iOS development.  Mobile development seems so more understandable to me! Now, I want to learn more and finish the tutor's app.
