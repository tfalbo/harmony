I would like to say that I am very happy. Last saturday, I was a coach at the [Django Girls - Rio de Janeiro](https://djangogirls.org/riodejaneiro/). It was a very long and tiring day, and I think specially for the participants. For most of them, it was their very first time programming. And also their very first time using the command line!

What once was a mystery, now it is something known. They have made their first step into the programming world! And I believe that it is the goal of the Django Girls. Making that first step, no matter how further, in direction of something new. Watching them learning Python, asking questions and that shine on their eyes was priceless!

It was my first experience as a coach, and I confess I was a bit nervous if I could "teach well" but, arriving there, this silly fear was gone. I met wonderful girls with different backgrounds, everybody was talking and sharing their experiences. It was a very welcoming environment!

We need more spaces like that, and I wish I could be a coach again at Django Girls or other events like that! :)
